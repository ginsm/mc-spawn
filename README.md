# spawn

This is my first Minecaft DataPack; I began learning how to create them last night. It's a bit different being unable to utilize variables easily and has challenged me to think outside the box thus far.

I have most of the features implemented but this is still largely a work-in-progress.

## Todo

- [x] load
  - [x] init
- [x] spawn:set
  - [x] spawn:scripts/getcoords
  - [x] Prevent setting spawn outside of overworld
- [x] spawn:scripts/teleport
  - [x] Multidimensional Teleport
- [ ] spawn:protect
