# spawn

This is my first Minecaft DataPack; I started learning how to create them last night. It's a bit different being unable to utilize variables easily and has challenged me to think outside the box.

So far the creation of spawn and a rudimentary teleportation has been created. I still need to ~~add multi-dimensional teleportation~~ and the ability to create a protection radius around the spawn.

The protection will set any player's gamemode to `adventure` upon entering the given radius.
